# Reinforcement-Learning-Examples

In this project, the three examples in Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Richard Sutton have been verified by Matlab Codes. 

The Car Rental example has been solved from 4 different reinfocement learning based methods, i.e., dynamice programming, monte-carlo, TD difference and the value iteration.

The gambler and maze examples are solved using one reinforcement learning method.

The gridworld example is solved through Monte-Carlo and temperal different methods.
